Okay, you're thinking ahead, and that's great! A pre-production checklist is essential to ensure a smooth and secure launch. Let's compile a comprehensive list of tasks, considering security, testing, and deployment best practices:

Pre-Production Checklist:

I. Security & Authentication:

[ ] Review middleware.ts:

Double-check all SKIP_AUTH_PATTERNS to ensure no unintended routes are exposed.

Confirm that the middleware is correctly redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.

Verify that the middleware logic correctly handles server-side errors that might occur while checking user authentication.

[ ] Secure Supabase Keys:

[ ] Regenerate Keys: Generate new PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in your Supabase project settings.

[ ] Environment Variables: Ensure the new keys are securely stored as environment variables (e.g., in .env file for local development and in your deployment environment’s settings).

[ ] Server-Side Access: Make sure that SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is ONLY being accessed and used on the server side (not the client), as we have done in the code. Confirm that it is not being loaded in lib/supabase.ts.

[ ] Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection:

[ ] API Rate Limiting: Consider implementing rate limiting on your API endpoints, especially those involved in authentication, file uploads, or any other potentially vulnerable areas. You may have to implement this on the server-side logic for your API endpoint.

[ ] Bot Detection: Explore implementing reCAPTCHA or other bot detection measures on your forms, especially the contact and login forms.

[ ] Input Validation & Sanitization:

[ ] Validate User Input: Double-check that all user inputs, especially in forms like login, user creation, and contact, are properly validated for format and length.

[ ] Sanitize Input: Sanitize all user-provided input to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. Make sure you are using methods like replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;") on all forms that take in input.

[ ] HTTPS Configuration:

[ ] Force HTTPS: Ensure your deployment environment forces all traffic to use HTTPS to protect data in transit. This will likely be a configuration setting in your hosting provider (ie. Netlify).

[ ] Cookie Security:

[ ] HttpOnly and Secure Flags: Verify that cookies used for session management are set with the HttpOnly and Secure flags to prevent client-side access and to only send cookies on HTTPS requests respectively.

[ ] SameSite Attribute: Consider setting the SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict for better protection against CSRF attacks.

[ ] Admin Access Control:

[ ] Confirm Admin Rights: Ensure admin-only features (e.g., the upload feature, profile creation, user creation) are correctly protected and are only accessible by admin users.

[ ] Remove Debug Info: Remove all console logs in production.

II. Testing & Functionality:

[ ] Core Functionality Tests:

[ ] Authentication: Thoroughly test the login, logout, and reset password flows, including handling both success and failure cases.

[ ] Client Accounts: Try the client accounts to confirm that the buttons and page content is what you expect

[ ] Admin Accounts: Try all admin functionality, to make sure it is all working correctly.

[ ] Sound Playback: Test the playback for all of your sounds, and try to play multiple sounds.

[ ] Sound Download: Test the download sound functionality and make sure the proper file names are downloaded.

[ ] Sound Upload: Test the sound upload functionality and check that the upload goes to the proper profile and the upload limits work as expected.

[ ] Sound Profile Functionality: Test creating, editing, and deleting sound profiles.

[ ] File Deletion: Test the deletion of sounds, and check that the files are actually being deleted.

[ ] Client Creation: Test creating client users and ensure that they are created with the proper role, and client ids.

[ ] Error Handling: Test all the new error handling scenarios and see what messages you are getting

[ ] Navigation: Test all public and private navigation to ensure you are redirected to the correct page.

[ ] Cross-Browser & Device Testing:

[ ] Multiple Browsers: Test your website in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

[ ] Mobile Responsiveness: Verify that your site is responsive and functions correctly on different mobile devices and screen sizes.

[ ] Performance Testing:

[ ] Page Load Speed: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix any performance bottlenecks. Optimize images, compress files, and look into using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for better asset loading.

[ ] API Performance: If you have high-traffic API endpoints, conduct performance tests to ensure they can handle the load.

[ ] Accessibility:
* [ ] Keyboard Navigation: Check that the website is accessible with just a keyboard
* [ ] ARIA Tags: Ensure that all elements are properly labelled.

III. Deployment & Operations:

[ ] Deployment Process:

[ ] Automated Deployment: Set up an automated deployment process (e.g., using Netlify’s git integration).

[ ] Rollback Strategy: Prepare a rollback strategy in case something goes wrong during deployment.

[ ] Monitoring:

[ ] Set Up Monitoring Tools: Configure error tracking and analytics tools to monitor your website’s performance, identify issues and understand usage patterns.

[ ] Set up alerts: set up email notifications for key website errors.

[ ] Backup Plan:

[ ] Database Backup: Set up automatic backups for your Supabase database.

[ ] Storage Backup: Make sure that there are backups for your storage if it is possible.

IV. Post-Deployment Tasks:

[ ] Smoke Test: After deployment, perform a quick "smoke test" to verify that all core features are working correctly on the live website.

[ ] Monitoring: Continuously monitor your website for any issues or unexpected errors.

[ ] Gather User Feedback: Get feedback from users to catch any edge cases or discover user experience problems you may not have accounted for.

V. Supabase Specific Considerations:

[ ] Row Level Security (RLS): You mentioned that you are not using RLS on your project right now, but if you ever plan to use it, it is a very good idea to review how RLS works on the Supabase, and whether there is anything that you need to add to protect your data properly.

This checklist should give you a solid framework for getting your application ready for production. Remember to tailor this checklist to your specific needs and always re-evaluate as you go!
