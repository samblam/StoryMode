# Survey Module Summary

## Current Status

I've analyzed the survey management module and found that your understanding of what needs to be done is accurate. Here's a summary of the current status:

### What's Working
- Basic survey creation and management
- Participant management (creation, listing, deletion)
- Database structure for surveys, participants, and responses
- API endpoints for core functionality
- UI components for most features

### What's Partially Working
- Survey preview (has bugs)
- Survey publishing and email distribution (implemented but needs testing)
- Data export (basic implementation exists)

### What's Missing or Broken
- Survey preview has a 404 error and undefined function issues
- Email distribution needs better error handling and templates
- Data export needs enhancement for more formats and better data presentation

## Completion Plan Highlights

I've created a detailed completion plan in `survey_module_completion_plan.md`. Here are the key points:

1. **Fix Critical Bugs First**
   - Resolve the survey preview 404 error and undefined function
   - Fix VideoPlayer callback errors
   - Address Supabase client initialization warnings

2. **Enhance Core Features**
   - Improve email templates and sending process
   - Add better error handling throughout
   - Upgrade basic data export functionality

3. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Implement PDF export
   - Create better data visualizations
   - Add automated reporting

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Comprehensive testing of all features
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed completion plan in `survey_module_completion_plan.md`
2. Prioritize the critical bug fixes, especially the survey preview functionality
3. Assign development resources to the tasks based on the implementation timeline
4. Set up a testing plan for each completed feature

The survey module is close to completion, with most of the foundational work already done. The remaining tasks are primarily focused on fixing bugs, enhancing existing features, and adding some advanced capabilities to improve the user experience.
