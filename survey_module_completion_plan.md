# Survey Module Completion Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to complete the survey management module based on the analysis of the current codebase and requirements.

## Requirements
1. Admin needs to be able to view preview of survey
2. When a survey is published, it needs to be emailed out to all participants (unique URL for each)
3. Survey responses need to be saved to DB
4. Admin must be able to view data and export it from the admin panel

## Current Status and Action Items

### 1. Survey Preview Functionality
**Status**: Partially implemented with bugs
- Components exist: `SurveyPreview.astro`
- API endpoint exists: `/api/surveys/[id]/preview.ts`
- Issues: 404 error, undefined function, VideoPlayer errors

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Fix 404 error on survey preview route
- [ ] Debug and fix `previewSurvey` function undefined error
- [ ] Resolve VideoPlayer callback errors
- [ ] Ensure preview mode properly displays survey without saving responses
- [ ] Add clear visual indication that user is in preview mode
- [ ] Test preview functionality end-to-end

### 2. Survey Publishing and Email Distribution
**Status**: Implemented but needs testing and enhancement
- API endpoint exists: `/api/surveys/[id]/publish.ts`
- Functionality for unique URLs exists in `participantUtils.ts`
- Email sending functionality exists in `emailUtils.ts`

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Test email sending functionality with real participants
- [ ] Enhance error handling for email failures
- [ ] Implement background job handling for large participant lists
- [ ] Create better email templates with proper formatting
- [ ] Add email preview functionality for admins
- [ ] Implement email tracking (opened, clicked)
- [ ] Add ability to resend emails to specific participants

### 3. Survey Response Saving
**Status**: Implemented
- API endpoint exists: `/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts`
- Saves responses and updates participant status

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add validation for response data
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Implement partial response saving (auto-save)
- [ ] Add response metadata (browser, device, time spent)
- [ ] Test with various response scenarios

### 4. Admin Data Viewing and Export
**Status**: Basic implementation exists
- Results page: `/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`
- Export component: `DataExporter.astro`
- Basic export API: `/api/surveys/[id]/export.ts`

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Enhance CSV export with more comprehensive data
- [ ] Implement PDF export functionality
- [ ] Add data filtering options
- [ ] Improve data visualizations
- [ ] Add export scheduling (automated reports)
- [ ] Implement data comparison between surveys
- [ ] Add custom report builder

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Fix Critical Bugs
- Fix survey preview functionality
- Test and fix survey publishing workflow
- Address Supabase client initialization warnings

### Week 2: Enhance Core Features
- Improve email templates and sending process
- Enhance response saving with validation
- Upgrade basic data export functionality

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- Implement PDF export
- Add advanced data visualizations
- Create automated reporting

### Week 4: Testing and Refinement
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## Technical Considerations

### Database Updates
- Ensure `participants` table has all necessary fields
- Add `sound_mapping_responses` column to `survey_responses` table
- Create appropriate indexes for performance

### API Enhancements
- Standardize error handling across all endpoints
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Add comprehensive logging

### UI Improvements
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Implement better error messaging
- Enhance accessibility

## Success Criteria
- Admin can successfully preview surveys before publishing
- Emails are reliably sent to all participants with correct unique URLs
- All survey responses are properly saved to the database
- Admin can view comprehensive data and export in multiple formats

## Conclusion
This plan addresses all the requirements while building on the existing codebase. By following this structured approach, we can efficiently complete the survey management module with high quality and reliability.
