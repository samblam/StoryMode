[2025-06-24 18:20:00] - Resolved Critical Vercel Build Error

## Decision

Refactored DataExporter.astro component to eliminate the problematic `client:load` + `define:vars` combination that was causing null byte path corruption during Vercel builds.

## Rationale

The build error `[astro:build] The argument 'path' must be a string, Uint8Array, or URL without null bytes. Received '/vercel/path0/\x00astro-entry:/vercel/path0/src/components/tsconfig.json'` was caused by Vite's module resolution system getting confused when processing the `define:vars` script in combination with the `client:load` directive. This created corrupted path strings with null bytes during the build process.

## Implementation Details

1. **Removed `client:load` directive** from DataExporter usage in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`
2. **Replaced `define:vars` script** with `is:inline` script in DataExporter.astro
3. **Implemented data attribute pattern** for passing server-side data to client-side JavaScript
4. **Converted to vanilla JavaScript** with proper null checks and error handling
5. **Removed conflicting tsconfig.json** from src/components/ directory
6. **Maintained full functionality** while ensuring build compatibility

This approach follows Astro best practices for client-side hydration and avoids the complex server-client variable injection that was causing the build system to fail.

[2025-06-28 17:15:00] - Failed to Resolve Sound Playback Issues

## Decision

Multiple attempts to fix the sound playback functionality in surveys have failed. The issue is related to client-side module loading in Astro.

## Rationale

The following approaches were attempted, each resulting in a new set of problems:

1.  **Correcting import path:** Changing the import from `.js` to `.ts` in `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` resolved the initial 404 but caused a `audioManager.play is not a function` error.
2.  **Client-side import:** Moving the import to a client-side `<script>` tag resulted in 404 errors for the imported modules.
3.  **`import.meta.glob`:** Using `import.meta.glob` to bundle the modules led to TypeScript-specific errors in a JavaScript context.
4.  **Removing type assertions:** Removing `as any` from the `import.meta.glob` implementation did not resolve the issue and resulted in a regression.

## Conclusion

The problem lies in the complex interaction between Astro's server-side rendering, client-side scripts, and module bundling. A new approach is needed to correctly import and use the `audioManager` and `clientUtils` modules on the client side.

[2025-06-28 17:20:00] - Successfully Resolved Sound Playback and Survey Submission Issues

## Decision

Fixed both critical survey issues through targeted debugging and code corrections.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Sound Playback Failure**: The client-side script in `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` was attempting to import `logClientEvent` from `clientUtils.ts`, but this function doesn't exist in that module. This caused the entire module import to fail, making `audioManager.play` unavailable.

2. **Survey Submission Authentication Failure**: The API endpoint `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` was querying the participants table using `.eq('participant_identifier', participantId)`, but the client was sending the participant's UUID as `participantId`, which should match the `id` field, not `participant_identifier`.

## Implementation Details

1. **Sound Playback Fix**:
   - Removed the non-existent `logClientEvent` import from `clientUtils`
   - Simplified the `import.meta.glob` to only load the `audioManager` module
   - Added an inline `logClientEvent` function for debugging purposes
   - This eliminates the module loading errors that were preventing audio playback

2. **Survey Submission Fix**:
   - Changed the database query from `.eq('participant_identifier', participantId)` to `.eq('id', participantId)`
   - This ensures proper participant authentication and prevents redirects to login page
   - Maintains the existing cookie-based authentication flow set up by the middleware

## Rationale

These fixes address the exact technical mismatches identified through systematic debugging rather than attempting complex workarounds. The solutions maintain the existing architecture while correcting the specific implementation errors.
