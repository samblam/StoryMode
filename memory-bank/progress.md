- Implemented participant status updates and access token invalidation upon survey submission
- Implemented survey response completed field update upon survey submission

- Resolved Vercel build error related to `src/components/tsconfig.json` and null byte path by refactoring `DataExporter.astro` and removing `client:load` directive.

## Current Tasks

1.  **Investigate Login Failure on Vercel Deployment**: The immediate priority is to resolve the login issue where `/api/auth/login` returns a 404 and HTML. This is blocking user access. (See `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for details and current hypothesis).

2.  **Address Technical Debt and Improvements:** Refer to `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md` for detailed areas of improvement, refactoring, and technical debt identified during the codebase review. This includes:
    *   Fixing `survey_matches` table data inconsistency (populating `sound_id` and `correct_match`).
    *   Reviewing redundancy in `soundMappingResponses` in `survey_responses`.
    *   Standardizing error handling and logging.
    *   Ensuring `surveyAnalytics.ts` derived properties are robustly handled.
    *   Investigating and removing the admin link from `src/pages/surveys/thank-you.astro`.
    *   Reviewing SMTP configuration and email sending logic for production readiness.

3.  **Fix Remaining Critical Bugs (NEXT PRIORITY):**
    *   Survey Creation Bug (400 error).
    *   Participant Management Bug (Sortable.js).
    *   Survey Preview Bug ("Play Sound" button).
    *   **[UNRESOLVED]** Sound playback in surveys is not functional. Multiple attempts to fix the issue have failed, and the root cause is still unknown. See `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for a detailed list of failed attempts.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   Test the enhanced answer saving implementation (after `survey_matches` fix).
    *   Test survey publishing and response saving workflow.
    *   Test the DataExporter component functionality after refactoring.

5.  **Existing Tasks:**
    *   Advanced analytics and reporting features
    *   Integration of sound profiles with surveys during response collection
    *   Enhanced user interface for survey creation and management
    *   Improved error handling and logging

## Next Steps

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. The critical Vercel build error has been resolved, but a new login issue has emerged post-deployment.

Key achievements:
- Fixed `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` by adding `type="module"` to the script tag in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`.
- Fixed error message in Analytics Dashboard by handling `undefined` `is_success` property in `calculateSuccessMetrics` function in `src/utils/surveyAnalytics.ts`.
- Resolved the Vercel build error related to `src/components/tsconfig.json` and the null byte path by refactoring `DataExporter.astro` and removing the `client:load` directive.

Current focus:
1.  **Resolving Login Failure on Vercel Deployment**: This is the immediate priority. The next developer should focus on debugging the `/api/auth/login` 404 issue.
2.  **Addressing Technical Debt and Improvements:** The next focus will be addressing the items outlined in `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md`.
3.  Fixing remaining critical bugs (Thank You page link, survey creation, participant management, survey preview).
4.  Testing the newly implemented features, especially the DataExporter component.
5.  Adding comprehensive user feedback and validation.
6.  Documenting the survey publishing workflow for administrators.

Recent implementations:
1. Integrated survey publishing with background job system for email sending
2. Added secure URL generation for participant survey access
3. Enhanced response saving with sound mapping data
4. Implemented email notifications for both survey invitations and completions
5. Added proper participant status transitions throughout the survey lifecycle (including completion and token invalidation).

These features have significantly improved the survey workflow, allowing for better participant management and more comprehensive data collection. The participant status management system now allows administrators to track the full lifecycle of participants from creation through activation to completion or expiration.
