2025-06-24 18:10:24 - Failed to resolve persistent Vercel build errors.
2025-06-24 18:19:35 - Successfully resolved Vercel build errors by refactoring DataExporter component.

## Current Focus

Attempting to deploy the application to Vercel, but encountering persistent build errors.

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Critical)

1.  **`[astro:build] The argument 'path' must be a string, Uint8Array, or URL without null bytes. Received '/vercel/path0/\x00astro-entry:/vercel/path0/src/components/tsconfig.json'`**
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED. This error was caused by the combination of `client:load` directive and `define:vars` script in the DataExporter component.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `define:vars` script in DataExporter.astro was causing Vite to incorrectly resolve TypeScript configuration paths during the build process, leading to corrupted path strings with null bytes.
    *   **Solution Applied**:
        *   Removed `client:load` directive from DataExporter usage in results.astro
        *   Refactored DataExporter.astro to use `is:inline` script instead of `define:vars`
        *   Replaced server-side variable injection with data attributes for client-side access
        *   Converted all client-side JavaScript to vanilla JS with proper null checks
        *   Removed the temporary `src/components/tsconfig.json` that was interfering with type resolution
    *   **Build Status**: ✅ Build now completes successfully on both local and Vercel environments

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Encountered)

1.  **Deprecated `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` import**: Fixed in `astro.config.mjs`.
2.  **Route Collisions (`/reset-password`, `/sounds`)**: Fixed by removing redundant `.astro` files (`src/pages/reset-password.astro`, `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`).
3.  **`"supabaseAdmin" is not exported` errors**: Systematically fixed in multiple `.ts` and `.astro` files by replacing direct `supabaseAdmin` imports with `getClient({ requiresAdmin: true })` and cleaning up `src/lib/supabase.ts`. Affected files included:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-session.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/login.ts`
    *   `src/components/ProfileForm.astro`
    *   `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro`
    *   `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`

## Recent Changes (Functional Fixes)

*   **`survey_matches` Data Inconsistency**:
    *   **Fixed**: Enriched the data payload from `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to include `intendedSoundId` and `matchedFunctionDescription`.
    *   **Fixed**: Updated the API endpoint at `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` to correctly process this new payload, calculate `correct_match`, and populate the `survey_matches` table with complete and accurate data.
*   **Broken "Play Sound" Button in Preview**:
    *   **Fixed**: Modified `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` to ensure that signed URLs for sounds are generated in preview mode, enabling the "Play Sound" buttons.
*   **TypeScript Errors in `matching.astro`**:
    *   **Fixed**: Refactored the `<script>` tag in `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to use standard JavaScript, resolving all client-side and server-side TypeScript errors.
*   **Inappropriate Header on "Thank You" Page**:
    *   **Fixed**: Added a `hideHeader` prop to `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
    *   **Fixed**: Implemented the `hideHeader={true}` prop on the `src/pages/surveys/thank-you.astro` page to provide a clean, final screen for survey participants.

## Next Steps (For the next developer)

✅ **Primary Build Issue Resolved**: The critical Vercel build error has been successfully fixed. The application now builds successfully.

### New Critical Issues: Survey Playback and Submission Failures

**Problem**: Test survey participants are encountering two main issues:
1.  **Sounds not playable**: Audio files are not loading or playing during the survey.
2.  **Redirect to login on submit**: When participants click the submit button, they are redirected to the login screen, and no responses are submitted. Consequently, no "thank you" email is sent.

**Analysis & Root Cause**:

*   **Redirect to Login on Submit**:
    *   **Root Cause**: The `src/middleware.ts` is designed to authenticate participants via a `participant-token` cookie. However, the client-side script in `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` is passing the `participant_id` and `token` in the **request body** of the `POST` request to `/api/surveys/[id]/responses`, not as a cookie. Since the middleware does not inspect the request body for authentication, it considers the request unauthenticated and redirects to the login page.
    *   **Impact**: This prevents the survey responses from ever reaching the `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` endpoint for processing and saving.

*   **Sounds not playable**:
    *   **Root Cause**: The "Play Sound" button is disabled if `surveySound.sounds?.url` is missing. This `url` is generated by `getSignedUrl` in `src/utils/storageUtils.ts`. This indicates that `getSignedUrl` is failing to generate valid, accessible URLs for the audio files.
    *   **Hypothesis**: The `storage_path` values stored in the Supabase `sounds` table might be incorrect or malformed, leading to `getSignedUrl` failing to produce a valid URL, or the generated URLs are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Possible Causes**: Incorrect `storage_path` values in the database, issues with Supabase Storage access permissions from the Vercel environment, or incorrect Supabase environment variables (`PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) on Vercel.

*   **No Thank You Email Sent**: This is a direct consequence of the survey submission failing due to the authentication issue. The email sending logic is triggered only after a successful response save.

**Current Priority Tasks (Analysis Only)**:
1.  **Analyze Participant Authentication for API Submission**: Confirm the exact values of `participant_id` and `token` being sent from `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` to `/api/surveys/[id]/responses` and how they are being processed by the middleware.
2.  **Analyze Sound Playback (Verify `storage_path`)**: Inspect the `storage_path` values for sounds associated with the survey directly from the Supabase database or through Vercel logs that show the `survey.survey_sounds` object.
3.  **End-to-End Testing**: After implementing fixes, thoroughly test the entire survey workflow (sound playback, submission, and email sending).
4.  **Continue with remaining issues**: Proceed with fixing other known bugs and implementing ongoing feature work as outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md`.
5.  **Monitor Build Stability**: Keep an eye on future builds to ensure the fix remains stable.

**Technical Debt Addressed**:
- ✅ Resolved problematic `define:vars` usage in Astro components
- ✅ Improved client-side JavaScript patterns for better build compatibility
- ✅ Cleaned up TypeScript configuration conflicts
