## Current Focus

Attempting to deploy the application to Vercel, but encountering persistent build errors.

### Unresolved Build Errors (High Priority)

1.  **`[astro:build] The argument 'path' must be a string, Uint8Array, or URL without null bytes. Received '/vercel/path0/\x00astro-entry:/vercel/path0/src/components/tsconfig.json'`**
    *   **Status**: Unresolved. This error occurs during the Vite build step on Vercel.
    *   **Details**: The error points to a non-existent `tsconfig.json` file within `src/components/` and contains a "null byte" (`\x00`) in the path, suggesting a corrupted path string. This error persists even after:
        *   Verifying `src/components/tsconfig.json` does not exist locally.
        *   Attempting "Redeploy without Build Cache" on Vercel multiple times.
        *   Temporarily created an empty `src/components/tsconfig.json` (which caused new TypeScript errors and was subsequently removed).
        *   Temporarily commented out `DataExporter.astro` (the component explicitly mentioned in the error trace) from `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro` to isolate the issue (this change was not pushed as the task was interrupted).
    *   **Conclusion**: The root cause remains elusive. It appears to be a deep-seated issue with how Astro/Vite handles file paths or module resolution in the Vercel build environment, possibly related to internal caching or a specific interaction with `DataExporter.astro`.

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Encountered)

1.  **Deprecated `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` import**: Fixed in `astro.config.mjs`.
2.  **Route Collisions (`/reset-password`, `/sounds`)**: Fixed by removing redundant `.astro` files (`src/pages/reset-password.astro`, `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`).
3.  **`"supabaseAdmin" is not exported` errors**: Systematically fixed in multiple `.ts` and `.astro` files by replacing direct `supabaseAdmin` imports with `getClient({ requiresAdmin: true })` and cleaning up `src/lib/supabase.ts`. Affected files included:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-session.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/login.ts`
    *   `src/components/ProfileForm.astro`
    *   `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro`
    *   `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`

## Recent Changes (Functional Fixes)

*   **`survey_matches` Data Inconsistency**:
    *   **Fixed**: Enriched the data payload from `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to include `intendedSoundId` and `matchedFunctionDescription`.
    *   **Fixed**: Updated the API endpoint at `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` to correctly process this new payload, calculate `correct_match`, and populate the `survey_matches` table with complete and accurate data.
*   **Broken "Play Sound" Button in Preview**:
    *   **Fixed**: Modified `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` to ensure that signed URLs for sounds are generated in preview mode, enabling the "Play Sound" buttons.
*   **TypeScript Errors in `matching.astro`**:
    *   **Fixed**: Refactored the `<script>` tag in `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to use standard JavaScript, resolving all client-side and server-side TypeScript errors.
*   **Inappropriate Header on "Thank You" Page**:
    *   **Fixed**: Added a `hideHeader` prop to `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
    *   **Fixed**: Implemented the `hideHeader={true}` prop on the `src/pages/surveys/thank-you.astro` page to provide a clean, final screen for survey participants.

## Next Steps (For the next developer)

The primary unresolved issue is the persistent Vercel build error related to `src/components/tsconfig.json` and the "null byte" path. This needs to be thoroughly investigated.

1.  **Revert temporary changes**: The temporary commenting out of `DataExporter.astro` in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro` should be reverted before further debugging.
2.  **Deep Dive into Astro/Vite Build Process**: Investigate how Astro/Vite handles `tsconfig.json` lookups and module resolution, especially for components. This might involve consulting Astro/Vite documentation, community forums, or debugging the build process more deeply.
3.  **Alternative `DataExporter` implementation**: If the issue is indeed tied to `DataExporter.astro`, consider rewriting it or replacing it with a different approach for data export.
4.  **Vercel Support**: If all else fails, consider reaching out to Vercel support with the detailed build logs.
5.  **Continue with other known issues**: Once the build is stable, proceed with fixing the remaining critical bugs and implementing ongoing feature work as outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md`.
