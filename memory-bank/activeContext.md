2025-06-24 18:19:35 - Successfully resolved Vercel build errors by refactoring DataExporter component.

## Current Focus

Attempting to deploy the application to Vercel, but encountering persistent build errors.

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Critical)

1.  **`[astro:build] The argument 'path' must be a string, Uint8Array, or URL without null bytes. Received '/vercel/path0/\x00astro-entry:/vercel/path0/src/components/tsconfig.json'`**
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED. This error was caused by the combination of `client:load` directive and `define:vars` script in the DataExporter component.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `define:vars` script in DataExporter.astro was causing Vite to incorrectly resolve TypeScript configuration paths during the build process, leading to corrupted path strings with null bytes.
    *   **Solution Applied**:
        *   Removed `client:load` directive from DataExporter usage in results.astro
        *   Refactored DataExporter.astro to use `is:inline` script instead of `define:vars`
        *   Replaced server-side variable injection with data attributes for client-side access
        *   Converted all client-side JavaScript to vanilla JS with proper null checks
        *   Removed the temporary `src/components/tsconfig.json` that was interfering with type resolution
    *   **Build Status**: ✅ Build now completes successfully on both local and Vercel environments

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Encountered)

1.  **Deprecated `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` import**: Fixed in `astro.config.mjs`.
2.  **Route Collisions (`/reset-password`, `/sounds`)**: Fixed by removing redundant `.astro` files (`src/pages/reset-password.astro`, `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`).
3.  **`"supabaseAdmin" is not exported` errors**: Systematically fixed in multiple `.ts` and `.astro` files by replacing direct `supabaseAdmin` imports with `getClient({ requiresAdmin: true })` and cleaning up `src/lib/supabase.ts`. Affected files included:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-session.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/login.ts`
    *   `src/components/ProfileForm.astro`
    *   `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro`
    *   `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`

## Recent Changes (Functional Fixes)

*   **`survey_matches` Data Inconsistency**:
    *   **Fixed**: Enriched the data payload from `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to include `intendedSoundId` and `matchedFunctionDescription`.
    *   **Fixed**: Updated the API endpoint at `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` to correctly process this new payload, calculate `correct_match`, and populate the `survey_matches` table with complete and accurate data.
*   **Broken "Play Sound" Button in Preview**:
    *   **Fixed**: Modified `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` to ensure that signed URLs for sounds are generated in preview mode, enabling the "Play Sound" buttons.
*   **TypeScript Errors in `matching.astro`**:
    *   **Fixed**: Refactored the `<script>` tag in `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to use standard JavaScript, resolving all client-side and server-side TypeScript errors.
*   **Inappropriate Header on "Thank You" Page**:
    *   **Fixed**: Added a `hideHeader` prop to `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
    *   **Fixed**: Implemented the `hideHeader={true}` prop on the `src/pages/surveys/thank-you.astro` page to provide a clean, final screen for survey participants.

## Next Steps (For the next developer)

✅ **Primary Build Issue Resolved**: The critical Vercel build error has been successfully fixed. The application now builds successfully.

### New Critical Issue: Login Failure on Vercel Deployment

**Problem**: After successful deployment, the login functionality is failing with a `404` error for `/api/auth/login` and a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`. This indicates the API endpoint is returning an HTML page (likely a 404 page) instead of a JSON response.

**Previous Hypothesis Update**: The Vercel runtime log indicated "No API Route handler exists for the method 'GET' for the route '/api/auth/login'. Found handlers: 'POST'". However, inspection of `src/components/LoginForm.astro` confirms the client is correctly sending a `POST` request.

**Revised Hypothesis**: The issue is not a client-side request method mismatch. It is likely a deeper problem with Vercel's routing or serverless function invocation for Astro API routes, where the `POST` request is either not reaching the correct serverless function or is being misrouted by Vercel's infrastructure. This could be due to:
    *   Vercel's internal routing configuration for Astro API routes.
    *   A specific interaction with the Astro Vercel adapter that causes this route to be inaccessible.
    *   Environment variables not being correctly picked up at runtime, causing the function to crash before handling the request (though less likely for a 404).

**Current Priority Tasks**:
1.  **Deep Dive into Vercel Serverless Function Logs**: Request detailed runtime logs for the `/api/auth/login` serverless function on Vercel. This includes any logs *before* the "No API Route handler exists" warning, or any logs indicating function startup/crash.
2.  **Review Vercel Project Settings**: Double-check Vercel project settings for any custom routing rules, redirects, or environment variable configurations that might affect API routes.
3.  **Simplify API Route (if logs are inconclusive)**: As a last resort, consider creating a very simple test API route (e.g., `/api/test`) that just returns "OK" to isolate if the issue is specific to the login route or all API routes.
4.  **End-to-End Testing**: Verify that the DataExporter component functions correctly in the deployed environment (after login is fixed).
5.  **Continue with remaining issues**: Proceed with fixing other known bugs and implementing ongoing feature work as outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md`.
6.  **Monitor Build Stability**: Keep an eye on future builds to ensure the fix remains stable.

**Technical Debt Addressed**:
- ✅ Resolved problematic `define:vars` usage in Astro components
- ✅ Improved client-side JavaScript patterns for better build compatibility
- ✅ Cleaned up TypeScript configuration conflicts
