2025-06-24 18:10:24 - Failed to resolve persistent Vercel build errors.
2025-06-24 18:19:35 - Successfully resolved Vercel build errors by refactoring DataExporter component.

## Current Focus

Attempting to deploy the application to Vercel, but encountering persistent build errors.

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Critical)

1.  **`[astro:build] The argument 'path' must be a string, Uint8Array, or URL without null bytes. Received '/vercel/path0/\x00astro-entry:/vercel/path0/src/components/tsconfig.json'`**
    *   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED. This error was caused by the combination of `client:load` directive and `define:vars` script in the DataExporter component.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `define:vars` script in DataExporter.astro was causing Vite to incorrectly resolve TypeScript configuration paths during the build process, leading to corrupted path strings with null bytes.
    *   **Solution Applied**:
        *   Removed `client:load` directive from DataExporter usage in results.astro
        *   Refactored DataExporter.astro to use `is:inline` script instead of `define:vars`
        *   Replaced server-side variable injection with data attributes for client-side access
        *   Converted all client-side JavaScript to vanilla JS with proper null checks
        *   Removed the temporary `src/components/tsconfig.json` that was interfering with type resolution
    *   **Build Status**: ✅ Build now completes successfully on both local and Vercel environments

### Resolved Build Errors (Previously Encountered)

1.  **Deprecated `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` import**: Fixed in `astro.config.mjs`.
2.  **Route Collisions (`/reset-password`, `/sounds`)**: Fixed by removing redundant `.astro` files (`src/pages/reset-password.astro`, `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`).
3.  **`"supabaseAdmin" is not exported` errors**: Systematically fixed in multiple `.ts` and `.astro` files by replacing direct `supabaseAdmin` imports with `getClient({ requiresAdmin: true })` and cleaning up `src/lib/supabase.ts`. Affected files included:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-session.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/verify-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/login.ts`
    *   `src/components/ProfileForm.astro`
    *   `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro`
    *   `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`

## Recent Changes (Functional Fixes)

*   **`survey_matches` Data Inconsistency**:
    *   **Fixed**: Enriched the data payload from `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to include `intendedSoundId` and `matchedFunctionDescription`.
    *   **Fixed**: Updated the API endpoint at `src/pages/api/surveys/[id]/responses.ts` to correctly process this new payload, calculate `correct_match`, and populate the `survey_matches` table with complete and accurate data.
*   **Broken "Play Sound" Button in Preview**:
    *   **Fixed**: Modified `src/pages/surveys/[id].astro` to ensure that signed URLs for sounds are generated in preview mode, enabling the "Play Sound" buttons.
*   **TypeScript Errors in `matching.astro`**:
    *   **Fixed**: Refactored the `<script>` tag in `src/pages/surveys/matching.astro` to use standard JavaScript, resolving all client-side and server-side TypeScript errors.
*   **Inappropriate Header on "Thank You" Page**:
    *   **Fixed**: Added a `hideHeader` prop to `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
    *   **Fixed**: Implemented the `hideHeader={true}` prop on the `src/pages/surveys/thank-you.astro` page to provide a clean, final screen for survey participants.

## Next Steps (For the next developer)

✅ **Primary Build Issue Resolved**: The critical Vercel build error has been successfully fixed. The application now builds successfully.

### ✅ Resolved: Incorrect Survey URLs in Emails

**Problem**: Survey invitation emails were sending out `localhost` links instead of the production Vercel URL.

**Root Cause**: The `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable was not being correctly picked up by the Vercel serverless function at runtime. This was confirmed by modifying the code to throw an error if the variable was not set, which then appeared in the Vercel logs.

**Solution Applied**:
1.  Modified `src/utils/participantUtils.ts` to throw an error if `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is not set, to confirm the issue.
2.  Instructed the user to ensure the `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable is applied to all environments (Production, Preview, Development) in the Vercel project settings.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED. The `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is now correctly picked up, and the correct URLs are being sent in emails.

**Current Priority Tasks**:
1.  **End-to-End Testing**: Thoroughly test the survey publishing workflow to ensure the correct URLs are being sent in emails and that the rest of the application is functioning as expected.
2.  **Continue with remaining issues**: Proceed with fixing other known bugs and implementing ongoing feature work as outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/technicalDebtAndImprovements.md`.
3.  **Monitor Build Stability**: Keep an eye on future builds to ensure the fix remains stable.

**Technical Debt Addressed**:
- ✅ Resolved problematic `define:vars` usage in Astro components
- ✅ Improved client-side JavaScript patterns for better build compatibility
- ✅ Cleaned up TypeScript configuration conflicts
