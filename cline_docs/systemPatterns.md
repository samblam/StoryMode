## System Patterns

**How the system is built:**

- The system follows a Model-View-Component (MVC) like structure, particularly in the frontend with Astro components.
- Backend logic is primarily within API routes.
- Data fetching and state management are handled by utility functions.

**Key technical decisions:**

- Using Astro for the frontend to build a fast, content-focused site.
- Utilizing TypeScript for type safety and better code organization.
- Using Supabase for database and authentication.

**Architecture patterns:**

- **API Routes for Backend Logic:** API routes in the `pages/api` directory handle backend logic, interacting with the database and other services.
- **Utility Functions for Data Handling:** Utility functions in the `utils` directory encapsulate data fetching, processing, and manipulation logic. This promotes reusability and keeps components and API routes cleaner.
- **Astro Components for UI:** Astro components in the `components` directory are used to build the user interface. These components manage their own state and rendering logic.
- **Data Manager Pattern:** The `surveyDataManager.ts` utility is used to manage survey data, providing an abstraction layer between the components/API routes and the database interactions.
- **State Manager Pattern:** The `surveyStateManager.ts` utility is used to manage the state of the current survey being taken by a user.
- **Analytics Architecture Pattern:** A comprehensive pattern for analytics and reporting:
  - **Core Analytics Layer** (`surveyAnalytics.ts`):
    - Handles metrics calculation and analysis
    - Processes performance and behavior data
    - Maintains separation of analysis concerns
    - Provides type-safe data processing

  - **Results Processing Layer** (`surveyResults.ts`):
    - Manages data transformation and preparation
    - Generates visualization-ready data structures
    - Handles data aggregation and formatting
    - Provides caching mechanisms for performance

  - **Export Management Layer** (`surveyExport.ts`):
    - Handles data export and format conversion
    - Manages data anonymization and security
    - Provides flexible export templates
    - Ensures data integrity during export

  - **Component Integration Layer**:
    - `AnalyticsDashboard.astro`: Analytics visualization and overview
    - `ReportGenerator.astro`: Comprehensive report generation
    - `DataExporter.astro`: Export interface and controls
    - Components use reactive patterns for real-time updates

  This layered architecture ensures:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Modular testing and maintenance
  - Efficient data processing
  - Scalable analytics operations
