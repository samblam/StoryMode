Subject: Handover - Survey Results Page Debugging

Hi [Senior QA Engineer Name],

I'm handing over the debugging of an issue on the survey results page (http://localhost:4322/admin/surveys/[survey_id]/results). The UI displays an error message, even though the database query is now successful.

Problem:

The survey results page displays an error message in the Analytics Dashboard, even though the server logs indicate that the data is being fetched correctly from the database.

Steps Taken:

*   Identified and fixed an incorrect table name in the database query for fetching survey responses in `src\pages\admin\surveys\[id]\results.astro` (changed `sound_matches` to `survey_matches`).
*   Corrected column names in the database query for fetching survey responses in `src\pages\admin\surveys\[id]\results.astro` (changed `function_id` to `matched_function` and removed `is_correct`).
*   Removed an invalid function call (`validateFormat`) in `src\pages\admin\surveys\[id]\results.astro`.

Remaining Issues:

*   The UI still displays the error message in the Analytics Dashboard.
*   The dev console shows an `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` error, which is likely related to ES module handling in Astro.
*   The server log shows warnings about incorrect use of the `DataExporter` component, but these are likely not related to the main issue.
*   The dev console shows a `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADBLOCKER` message, which indicates that an ad blocker is preventing a script from loading.
*   The dev console shows a `Sortable.js not loaded` message, which could be related to the ad blocker or other script loading issues.

Next Steps:

*   Investigate the root cause of the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` error and find a solution.
*   Consider if the ad blocker and Sortable.js loading issues are related to the main problem.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
