# Active Context

## Current Task
Investigating Sound Mapping Data Access Failures in Survey Edit Page:
1. Database Query Issues:
   - Fixed "column sounds.url does not exist" error by updating to use file_path
   - Fixed "relation 'public.functions' does not exist" error by querying survey_sounds
   - Implemented proper data fetching from both tables

2. Implementation Changes:
   - Updated sound query to include all required fields
   - Changed function data source to survey_sounds.intended_function
   - Fixed type safety throughout component
   - Removed references to non-existent 'url' field

3. Key Files Modified:
   - src/components/admin/SoundManager.astro
     * Updated database queries
     * Fixed type definitions
     * Corrected field references

4. Current Status:
   - Sound query now uses correct fields
   - Functions are properly sourced from survey_sounds
   - Type safety is maintained
   - All TypeScript errors resolved

## Recent Changes
- Fixed Sound Mapping Data Access:
  * Corrected sound field references
  * Updated function data source
  * Improved type safety
  * Fixed query structures
- Previous Updates:
  * Fixed client dropdown selection
  * Improved error messages
  * Reduced console noise
  * Better type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Testing:
   - Verify sound data loading
   - Test function selection
   - Check preview functionality
   - Validate mapping creation

2. Validation:
   - Ensure proper data display
   - Verify audio preview works
   - Check mapping persistence
   - Test error handling

3. Documentation:
   - Update code comments
   - Document data structure
   - Note query patterns
   - Record type definitions
