# Active Context

## Current Tasks

### 1. Video Player Signed URL Issue
- Status: Ongoing investigation
- Recent changes:
  - Removed storageUtils.ts dependency
  - Implemented direct Supabase storage access in VideoPlayer
  - Fixed path handling and normalization
  - Added error handling and logging
  - Fixed TypeScript errors
- Current state:
  - Still getting "Object not found" errors
  - Path handling improvements did not resolve the issue
  - Direct storage access still fails
  - Previous fixes attempted:
    1. File existence verification (failed)
    2. Path normalization (failed)
    3. Direct storage access (failed)

### Investigation Areas
1. Authentication Analysis:
   - Test implementation uses regular client successfully
   - VideoPlayer using client-side initialization
   - Need to verify authentication flow and permissions
   - Possible service role key requirement

2. Storage Configuration:
   - Verify bucket policies allow client access
   - Check if service role key is required
   - Compare successful vs failing requests
   - Review storage initialization timing

3. Path Handling:
   - Upload stores as: `videos/<surveyId>/video.<ext>`
   - Test implementation uses: `<surveyId>/video.<ext>`
   - Need to verify exact path requirements
   - Investigate potential path encoding issues

## Next Steps
1. Review Supabase storage bucket policies
2. Compare authentication between test and VideoPlayer
3. Verify exact path requirements in storage
4. Test with service role key if needed
5. Consider implementing server-side URL generation
6. Investigate potential race conditions in initialization
