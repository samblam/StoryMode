# Active Context

## Current Tasks

### 1. Audio Loading Optimization
- Status: Initial implementation complete, pending verification
- Implemented features:
  - Loading state management with progress tracking
  - Visual loading indicators and progress bars
  - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
  - Button state synchronization
  - Memory management improvements
- Implementation details:
  1. AudioManager enhancements:
     - Added loading state tracking
     - Implemented progress monitoring
     - Added error state handling
     - Improved cleanup routines
  2. UI Components:
     - Created LoadingIndicator component
     - Enhanced SoundList component
     - Added button state management
     - Improved error visualization
- Next steps:
  1. Performance verification:
     - Measure loading times
     - Monitor memory usage
     - Test browser compatibility
     - Verify mobile performance
  2. User experience testing:
     - Verify loading indicators
     - Test error handling
     - Check progress accuracy
     - Validate cleanup routines

### 2. Video Player Signed URL Issue
- Status: Ongoing investigation
- Recent changes:
  - Removed storageUtils.ts dependency
  - Implemented direct Supabase storage access in VideoPlayer
  - Fixed path handling and normalization
  - Added error handling and logging
  - Fixed TypeScript errors
- Current state:
  - Still getting "Object not found" errors
  - Path handling improvements did not resolve the issue
  - Direct storage access still fails
  - Previous fixes attempted:
    1. File existence verification (failed)
    2. Path normalization (failed)
    3. Direct storage access (failed)

## Investigation Areas
1. Audio Performance Analysis:
   - Loading time measurements
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Browser compatibility issues
   - Mobile device performance
   - Error recovery effectiveness

2. Authentication Analysis:
   - Test implementation uses regular client successfully
   - VideoPlayer using client-side initialization
   - Need to verify authentication flow and permissions
   - Possible service role key requirement

3. Storage Configuration:
   - Verify bucket policies allow client access
   - Check if service role key is required
   - Compare successful vs failing requests
   - Review storage initialization timing

4. Path Handling:
   - Upload stores as: `videos/<surveyId>/video.<ext>`
   - Test implementation uses: `<surveyId>/video.<ext>`
   - Need to verify exact path requirements
   - Investigate potential path encoding issues

## Next Steps
1. Audio System Verification:
   - Run performance tests
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test browser compatibility
   - Verify mobile performance
   - Gather user feedback

2. Video Player:
   - Review Supabase storage bucket policies
   - Compare authentication between test and VideoPlayer
   - Verify exact path requirements in storage
   - Test with service role key if needed
   - Consider implementing server-side URL generation
   - Investigate potential race conditions in initialization
