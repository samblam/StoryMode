# Active Context

## Current Task
Debugging database query and client relationship issues:

1. Database Query Issue:
   - Error: "column sounds_2.url does not exist"
   - Root cause identified:
     * Sound URLs are generated from storage_path using signed URLs
     * Need to fetch storage_path and generate URLs dynamically
   - Latest fix attempt:
     * Updated query to use correct sound table columns
     * Added signed URL generation in surveyDataManager
     * Fixed TypeScript types for sound relationships
     * Added proper error handling for URL generation

2. Client Relationship Issue:
   - Problem: Null client despite valid client_id
   - Investigation findings:
     * Database schema shows client_id as nullable foreign key
     * Join structure needed adjustment
   - Latest fix attempt:
     * Removed inner join constraint on clients
     * Maintained optional client relationship
     * Updated types to reflect nullable relationship

## Recent Changes
- Modified survey query structure in [id].ts:
  * Added proper join conditions
  * Updated column references
  * Added profile_id to sound selection
- Updated surveyDataManager.ts:
  * Added signed URL generation
  * Fixed TypeScript types
  * Added error handling
  * Improved type safety
- Integrated with storageUtils for URL generation

## Next Steps
1. Testing:
   - Verify signed URL generation
   - Test client relationship handling
   - Check error handling
   - Monitor performance

2. Error Handling:
   - Verify URL generation failures
   - Test client data fallbacks
   - Monitor error logging
   - Check user feedback

3. Performance:
   - Monitor URL generation impact
   - Check query efficiency
   - Test with large datasets
   - Verify memory usage
