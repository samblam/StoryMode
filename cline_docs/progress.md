## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing a critical bug on the survey results page and addressing `supabaseAdmin` import errors.

Key achievements:

*   Fixed `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` by adding `type="module"` to the script tag in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`.
*   Fixed error message in Analytics Dashboard by handling `undefined` `is_success` property in `calculateSuccessMetrics` function in `src/utils/surveyAnalytics.ts`.
*   Identified that the `"__vite_ssr_import_2__.validateFormat is not a function"` error is caused by `DataExporter.astro` calling a non-existent API endpoint. This issue requires further investigation.
*   âœ… Fixed `supabaseAdmin` import errors in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
*   âœ… Resolved route collisions by removing duplicate route definitions in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/reset-password.astro`
    *   `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`

## Analytics Platform Development & Security Audit (COMPLETED)

### Comprehensive Analysis Completed (January 2025)
1.  **Data Visualization Analysis** - Complete technical assessment of Chart.js integration, analytics dashboard functionality, and visualization components
2.  **Raw Data Export Analysis** - Comprehensive evaluation of export APIs, data processing, and format support
3.  **Unified Development Plan** - Strategic 10-week roadmap combining both analyses with prioritized implementation phases
4.  **Analytics Platform Security Review** - Comprehensive security assessment identifying critical vulnerabilities and providing mitigation strategies for UX sound design application
5.  **Complete Application Security Audit** - Full codebase security assessment with development-aware recommendations and production security roadmap

- Caching system and batch processing for performance optimization

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- **P0 Critical**: Placeholder data processing functions in `src/utils/surveyVisualization.ts` (lines 174-207)
- **P0 Critical**: Missing export validation endpoint causing UI errors in `DataExporter.astro`
- **P1 High**: Incomplete PDF export implementation despite jsPDF dependencies
- **P1 High**: Chart.js memory management issues in long-running sessions

3.  **Security Integration**: Audit logging, export controls, session timeout enforcement
4.  **Remaining UI Bugs**: Thank-you page admin link, survey creation 400 error, participant management Sortable.js
5.  **Security Testing**: Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, security code reviews
6.  **Testing**: Survey publishing workflow, response saving verification with security validation

### Previous Implementations (Completed)
1.  Integrated survey publishing with background job system for email sending
2.  Added secure URL generation for participant survey access
3.  Enhanced response saving with sound mapping data
4.  Implemented email notifications for both survey invitations and completions
5.  Added proper participant status transitions throughout the survey lifecycle

The analytics platform analysis has revealed a solid architectural foundation with comprehensive export capabilities and proper Chart.js integration. The comprehensive security audit has identified security considerations that should be addressed before production deployment, with proper recognition of the active development context. The main development focus continues with strategic platform enhancement and integrated security planning, providing a clear roadmap for achieving secure, enterprise-grade analytics functionality appropriate for a UX sound design platform handling client intellectual property and participant data.

### Security Investment Summary (Updated)
- **Additional Security Cost**: $8,000 (6% of total project budget, adjusted for development context)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects client sound libraries and participant data with production-appropriate security
- **Compliance**: Supports GDPR requirements for EU participants
- **Business Value**: Enables enterprise client acquisition with appropriate security controls
- **Development Efficiency**: Maintains development velocity while ensuring production security readiness
