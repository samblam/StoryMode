## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing critical bugs and implementing a comprehensive participant status management system.

Key achievements:
- Fixed participant deletion functionality
- Completely fixed survey preview functionality with all UI improvements
- Created proper response submission API endpoint with sound mapping support
- Added thank-you page for post-submission confirmation
- Implemented comprehensive participant status management
- Fixed participant upload forms (manual, CSV, JSON)
- Created survey publishing endpoint with participant status updates
- Added support for batch status operations
- Implemented participant status updates and access token invalidation upon survey submission
- Implemented survey response completed field update upon survey submission

Current focus:
1. Testing the newly implemented survey publishing and response saving features
2. Fixing remaining critical bugs (survey creation bug and sortable.js integration)
3. Adding comprehensive user feedback and validation
4. Documenting the survey publishing workflow for administrators
5. Implementing a new approach to answer saving in `survey_matches`. The current approach results in null values. The proposed solution is to assign question IDs in the `surveys` table and send them with the responses.

Recent implementations:
1. Integrated survey publishing with background job system for email sending
2. Added secure URL generation for participant survey access
3. Enhanced response saving with sound mapping data
4. Implemented email notifications for both survey invitations and completions
5. Added proper participant status transitions throughout the survey lifecycle

These features have significantly improved the survey workflow, allowing for better participant management and more comprehensive data collection. The participant status management system now allows administrators to track the full lifecycle of participants from creation through activation to completion or expiration.
