## CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE (January 29, 2025)

**Analytics Visualization Failure** - Data processing works correctly but charts not rendering in UI

### Issue Status
- ✅ **Analytics Processing**: Functions correctly parse JSONB data and calculate metrics
- ✅ **Database Queries**: All 400 errors resolved, queries execute successfully
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Server-side analytics processing pipeline functional
- ❌ **Chart Visualizations**: No charts/graphs appear in UI despite valid data
- ❌ **Error Logging**: Silent failure - no error messages in browser console or terminal

### Recent Debug Work Completed
- Fixed 400 Bad Request errors from Supabase queries
- Updated database schema types to match actual JSONB structure
- Implemented comprehensive analytics processing for JSONB data
- Added detailed logging showing successful data processing (16 responses, 64 attempts)
- Identified data quality issue (incorrect `matched: false` values in database)

### Investigation Required
1. Client-side Chart.js integration and CDN loading
2. Data handoff from server-side processing to client-side rendering
3. Canvas element initialization and JavaScript execution
4. Chart generation scripts and event listeners

## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing a critical bug on the survey results page and addressing `supabaseAdmin` import errors.

Key achievements:

*   Fixed `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` by adding `type="module"` to the script tag in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`.
*   Fixed error message in Analytics Dashboard by handling `undefined` `is_success` property in `calculateSuccessMetrics` function in `src/utils/surveyAnalytics.ts`.
*   Identified that the `"__vite_ssr_import_2__.validateFormat is not a function"` error is caused by `DataExporter.astro` calling a non-existent API endpoint. This issue requires further investigation.
*   ✅ Fixed `supabaseAdmin` import errors in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
*   ✅ Resolved route collisions by removing duplicate route definitions in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/reset-password.astro`
    *   `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`

## Current Sticking Point
The `generateCorrelationChart` function in `src/utils/surveyVisualization.ts` is encountering a TypeScript error: `Property 'data' does not exist on type '{}'` at line 181. This occurs because `correlationData` is inferred as a plain empty object `{}`, even though it's expected to have a `data` property which is an array. This is due to the fallback value of `safeAnalyticsOperation` returning `{ data: [] }`. The previous attempt to fix this by adding `!(correlationData as any).data` was interrupted.
