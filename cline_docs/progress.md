# Progress

## What Works

- User authentication and authorization
- Survey creation and listing
- Sound file uploading and management
- Sound profile creation and management
- Basic survey response collection
- Initial implementation of participant generation UI and API endpoints (needs debugging)

## What's Left to Build

1. Participant Status Management:
   - Add status column to participants table
   - Update participant creation to set initial "inactive" status
   - Implement status transitions (inactive -> active -> completed)
   - Add validation and error handling

2. Survey Preview:
   - Create preview functionality for admins
   - Implement preview mode that doesn't save responses
   - Add preview UI in admin dashboard

3. Survey Publishing:
   - Create publish endpoint
   - Generate unique URLs for participants
   - Implement email sending functionality
   - Update participant statuses on publish
   - Add background job handling for large participant lists

4. Enhanced Response Saving:
   - Add sound_mapping_responses to survey_responses table
   - Update response saving logic
   - Implement participant status updates on completion
   - Add validation and error handling

5. Existing Tasks:
   - Advanced analytics and reporting features
   - Integration of sound profiles with surveys during response collection
   - Enhanced user interface for survey creation and management
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Debug and fix participant generation functionality:
     - Fix issues with participant creation methods
     - Add proper error handling and validation
     - Implement participant list view and management
     - Add comprehensive testing

## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, and sound management implemented. Recent work has focused on participant generation features, which require debugging and enhancement. 

New development is now focused on:
1. Implementing participant status management
2. Adding survey preview capabilities
3. Creating survey publishing workflow with unique URLs
4. Enhancing response saving with sound mapping data

These features will significantly improve the survey workflow, allowing for better participant management and more comprehensive data collection. The changes will be implemented incrementally, starting with database schema updates and progressing through the UI and API implementations.
