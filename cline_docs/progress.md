   - Implement preview mode that doesn't save responses
   - Add preview UI in admin dashboard

3. Survey Publishing:
   - Create publish endpoint
   - Generate unique URLs for participants
   - Implement email sending functionality
   - Update participant statuses on publish
   - Add background job handling for large participant lists

4. Enhanced Response Saving:
   - Add sound_mapping_responses to survey_responses table
   - Update response saving logic
   - Implement participant status updates on completion
   - Add validation and error handling

5. Existing Tasks:
   - Advanced analytics and reporting features
   - Integration of sound profiles with surveys during response collection
   - Enhanced user interface for survey creation and management
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, and sound management implemented. Recent work has focused on participant management features, with successful implementation of participant creation, listing, and deletion functionality.

New development is now focused on:
1. Implementing participant status management
2. Adding survey preview capabilities
3. Creating survey publishing workflow with unique URLs
4. Enhancing response saving with sound mapping data

These features will significantly improve the survey workflow, allowing for better participant management and more comprehensive data collection. The changes will be implemented incrementally, starting with database schema updates and progressing through the UI and API implementations.
