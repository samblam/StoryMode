     * Update logout API endpoint
     * Implement proper error handling
     * Add loading states and feedback

3. Audio Loading Optimization:
   - Status: Initial implementation complete
   - Implemented features:
     * Loading state management
     * Progress tracking
     * Visual loading indicators
     * Error handling improvements
     * Button state management
   - Pending verification:
     * Performance impact
     * Memory usage
     * User experience
     * Browser compatibility

4. Video Player Implementation:
   - Investigating signed URL retrieval failures
   - Multiple approaches tried without success:
     * File existence verification
     * Path normalization
     * Direct storage access
   - Need to focus on authentication and storage configuration
