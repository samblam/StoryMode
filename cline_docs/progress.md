## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing critical bugs in the participant submission workflow.

Key achievements:
- Fixed participant deletion functionality
- Completely fixed survey preview functionality with all UI improvements
- Created proper response submission API endpoint with sound mapping support
- Added thank-you page for post-submission confirmation
- Implemented comprehensive participant status management
- Fixed participant upload forms (manual, CSV, JSON)
- Created survey publishing endpoint with participant status updates
- Added support for batch status operations
- Implemented participant status updates and access token invalidation upon survey submission
- Implemented survey response completed field update upon survey submission

Current focus:
1.  **Implementing Enhanced Answer Saving:** The primary focus is implementing the new approach for saving answers to `survey_matches` by assigning and using question IDs. (See `cline_docs/ai_engineer_development_plan.md`).
2.  Fixing remaining critical bugs (Thank You page link, survey creation, participant management, survey preview).
3.  Testing the newly implemented features.
4.  Adding comprehensive user feedback and validation.
5.  Documenting the survey publishing workflow for administrators.

Recent implementations:
1. Integrated survey publishing with background job system for email sending
2. Added secure URL generation for participant survey access
3. Enhanced response saving with sound mapping data
4. Implemented email notifications for both survey invitations and completions
5. Added proper participant status transitions throughout the survey lifecycle (including completion and token invalidation).

These features have significantly improved the survey workflow, allowing for better participant management and more comprehensive data collection. The participant status management system now allows administrators to track the full lifecycle of participants from creation through activation to completion or expiration.
