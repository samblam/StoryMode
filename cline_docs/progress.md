## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing critical bugs and implementing a comprehensive participant status management system.

Key achievements:
- Fixed participant deletion functionality
- Completely fixed survey preview functionality with all UI improvements

- Added thank-you page for post-submission confirmation
- Implemented comprehensive participant status management
- Fixed participant upload forms (manual, CSV, JSON)
