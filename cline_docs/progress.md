## Progress Status

The project is in active development with core functionality for user management, survey creation, sound management, participant management, and survey workflow implementation completed. Recent work has focused on fixing a critical bug on the survey results page and addressing `supabaseAdmin` import errors.

Key achievements:

*   Fixed `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` by adding `type="module"` to the script tag in `src/pages/admin/surveys/[id]/results.astro`.
*   Fixed error message in Analytics Dashboard by handling `undefined` `is_success` property in `calculateSuccessMetrics` function in `src/utils/surveyAnalytics.ts`.
*   Identified that the `"__vite_ssr_import_2__.validateFormat is not a function"` error is caused by `DataExporter.astro` calling a non-existent API endpoint. This issue requires further investigation.
*   ✅ Fixed `supabaseAdmin` import errors in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/admin-reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/create-user.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/send-reset-code.ts`
    *   `src/pages/api/auth/test-token.ts`
*   ✅ Resolved route collisions by removing duplicate route definitions in the following files:
    *   `src/pages/reset-password.astro`
    *   `src/pages/sounds/index.astro`

## Analytics Platform Development (NEW FOCUS)

### Comprehensive Analysis Completed (January 2025)
1.  **Data Visualization Analysis** - Complete technical assessment of Chart.js integration, analytics dashboard functionality, and visualization components
2.  **Raw Data Export Analysis** - Comprehensive evaluation of export APIs, data processing, and format support
3.  **Unified Development Plan** - Strategic 10-week roadmap combining both analyses with prioritized implementation phases

### Current Implementation Status: 75-80% Complete
**What Works:**
- Chart.js v4.4.7 properly integrated across multiple components
- Analytics dashboard with success metrics, sound performance analysis, participant behavior tracking
- CSV and JSON export functionality fully operational with comprehensive filtering
- Proper security controls with admin-only access and data anonymization
- Caching system and batch processing for performance optimization

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- **P0 Critical**: Placeholder data processing functions in `src/utils/surveyVisualization.ts` (lines 174-207)
- **P0 Critical**: Missing export validation endpoint causing UI errors in `DataExporter.astro`
- **P1 High**: Incomplete PDF export implementation despite jsPDF dependencies
- **P1 High**: Chart.js memory management issues in long-running sessions

### Strategic Documentation Created
- `cline_docs/data-visualization-analysis.md` - Technical analysis of Chart.js implementation and visualization components
- `cline_docs/raw-data-export-analysis.md` - Comprehensive export functionality review with API documentation
- `cline_docs/data-analytics-development-plan.md` - Unified development roadmap with 3-phase implementation, resource requirements, and success metrics

### Development Roadmap (10-Week Plan)
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Foundation**
- Replace placeholder data processing functions with real survey data transformation
- Create missing export validation API endpoint
- Complete PDF export implementation with jsPDF integration

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7): Enhancement**
- Advanced Chart.js configurations with real-time updates
- Enhanced UI components with progress indicators
- Performance optimizations and memory leak prevention

**Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10): Integration**
- Streaming exports for large datasets
- Automated report scheduling
- Advanced analytics features and customization options

### Legacy Bug Fixes (Background Priority)
1.  Enhanced Answer Saving: Assign question IDs in surveys table for proper survey_matches data
2.  Remaining UI Bugs: Thank-you page admin link, survey creation 400 error, participant management Sortable.js
3.  Testing: Survey publishing workflow, response saving verification

### Previous Implementations (Completed)
1.  Integrated survey publishing with background job system for email sending
2.  Added secure URL generation for participant survey access
3.  Enhanced response saving with sound mapping data
4.  Implemented email notifications for both survey invitations and completions
5.  Added proper participant status transitions throughout the survey lifecycle

The analytics platform analysis has revealed a solid architectural foundation with comprehensive export capabilities and proper Chart.js integration. The main development focus has shifted from bug fixes to strategic platform enhancement, with a clear roadmap for achieving enterprise-grade analytics functionality.
