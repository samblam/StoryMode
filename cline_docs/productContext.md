## Purpose

This project aims to develop a full-stack application for creating, managing, and analyzing surveys. The application allows users to create surveys, associate them with sound profiles, collect responses, and analyze the results.

## Problems Solved

-   Allows for the integration of sound profiles with surveys to study the impact of audio on responses.
-   Facilitates the collection and analysis of survey data.
-   Offers tools for managing user accounts and access control.

## How It Should Work

The application consists of a frontend built with Astro and a backend API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. Users can create surveys, upload sound files, define sound profiles, and associate them with surveys. The application collects responses and provides tools for analyzing the results, including visualizations and data export.
